# Dashboard Admin

Finding cheap and reputable hostels can now be searched through intermediary websites with the most detailed information about each hostel and room for rent. In the past, students and working people who needed to find a room to rent would manually search for each street and corner, which took both time and effort. With such accommodation search websites, you don't have to stay on the street all day to find a room, but have information about the room, price and characteristics of the room right away. Then it is easier for us to communicate with the innkeeper when there is a need to rent.

## Installation

Before anything else, make sure nodejs and npm are installed on your machine. If not, follow [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and then proceed with the next steps:

yarn add body-parser
yarn add mysql
```

```bash
cd asmsever
```

```bash
yarn start
```

## Running

The project is now on your machine and all dependencies will be installed. All that's left to do is launch the project. You can do it by running my command:

This will run the server including the commands to execute in the web page

If you want to prepare the project to production, then all you have to do is run:
```bash
